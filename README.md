# Luke's Auto-Rice Bootstraping Scripts (LARBS)

## This has been modified for my particular needs. I recommend using the original as it is far better in almost every case.

## Installation:

On an Arch based distribution as root, run the following:

```
curl -LO larbs.xyz/larbs.sh
sh larbs.sh
```

That's it.

## What is LARBS?

LARBS is a script that autoinstalls and autoconfigures a fully-functioning
and minimal terminal-and-vim-based Arch Linux environment.

LARBS was originally intended to be run on a fresh install of Arch Linux, and
provides you with a fully configured diving-board for work or more
customization. But LARBS also works on already configured systems *and* other
Arch-based distros such as Manjaro, Antergos and Parabola (although Parabola,
which uses slightly different repositories might miss one or two minor
programs).
