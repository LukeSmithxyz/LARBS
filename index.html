<p>LARBS is an efficient shell script that will install a fully-featured tiling window manager-based system on any Arch Linux-based system, without any of the routine of manual post-install processes and configuration.</p>

<p>By default, LARBS installs and deploys <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/voidrice">my own personal dotfiles</a> which people may know from <a target="_blank" href="https://youtube.com/c/lukesmithxyz">my videos on YouTube</a>.</p>

<p>
But LARBS can also be forked <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/larbs">on Github</a> or given command line options to customize it for your own needs: you can have it deploy your own dotfiles and install all prerequisite programs, as LARBS only needs to read a single list of programs, and the script itself is designed to be easily rearranged.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>On any (preferrably fresh) install of an Arch Linux-based distribution, just run the following as the root user:</p>

<code>
curl -LO larbs.xyz/larbs.sh</br>
bash larbs.sh
</code>

<p>LARBS will then guide you through installation, which is typically relatively snappy. On my very slow internet, it takes around 10 minutes.</p>

<h2>What does LARBS install?</h2>

<p>You can check out the programs list that LARBS parses for installation <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS/blob/master/progs.csv">right here!</a> It also gives a brief explanation of why the program is included.</p>

<p>Note that making your own fork of LARBS is as easy as using your own dotfiles, making a programs file like the one above, and making any other direct changes to the script you want.</p>

<h2>Learning the system is fun and easy!</h2>

<p>You can figure out about the system in a lot of different ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The documentation on the <a href="https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/voidrice">Github</a> page.</li>
	<li>By pressing Super+F1 while in the system itself at any time. (Also <a href="larbs_readme.pdf">here</a>.)</li>
	<li>The many illustrative videos on <a target="_blank" href="https://youtube.com/lukesmithxyz">my YouTube channel</a>, some of which are easily watchable in LARBS by pressing <code>super+shift+e</code>.</li>
	<li>By just installing it and diving in!</li>
</ul>
